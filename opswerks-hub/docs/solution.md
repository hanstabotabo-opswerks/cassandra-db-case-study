# Solution Description

The team developed a microservices-based solution with a web application integrated with a Cassandra NoSQL database. Using Kubernetes, the system ensures scalability and security by isolating environments. The React-based web application interacts with Cassandra through a secure API, which implements authentication and authorization protocols to protect database access.
